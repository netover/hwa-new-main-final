{#
    Template for extracting fields from TWS/HWA log entries.

    The Promptify pipeline will substitute the ``text`` variable at
    runtime.  The instructions below tell the language model to
    return a JSON object containing specific keys.  If a value is
    unknown it should be null.  Status values are constrained to
    known states (SUCC, ABEND, RUNNING, HOLD) or null.  The model
    should keep its answers concise.

You are an expert scheduling analyst. Extract the following fields from the TWS/HWA log text.
Return ONLY a valid JSON object with these keys:

{
  "job_id": string | null,
  "workstation": string | null,
  "status": "SUCC" | "ABEND" | "RUNNING" | "HOLD" | null,
  "timestamp": string | null,
  "root_cause": string | null
}

Rules:
- If a field is unknown, return null.
- "status" must be one of: SUCC, ABEND, RUNNING, HOLD (or null).
- Keep messages short (<= 140 chars).

Log:
{{ text }}
