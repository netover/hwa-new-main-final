## Migration Guide

### For Existing Code

No breaking changes. All enhancements are backward compatible.

### Recommended Updates

1. **Replace manual resource cleanup with context managers:**
   ```python

   conn = await pool.get_connection()
   try:
       result = await conn.execute(query)

       await conn.close()
   
   # After
   async with managed_database_connection(pool) as conn:
       result = await conn.execute(query)
   ```

2. **Add performance monitoring to critical paths:**
   ```python
   from resync.core.performance_optimizer import get_performance_service
   
   service = get_performance_service()
   cache_monitor = await service.register_cache("critical_cache")
   ```

3. **Enable health monitoring:**
   ```python
   # Add to monitoring dashboard
   health_status = await requests.get("/api/performance/health")
   ```
