## Topic : Dependency Injection.
Dependency Injection classes are usually added with modules `fastapi`.

Using Dependency Injection.


Agents Managers is a API(Class)
 ====
Refactoring a Singleton Pattern

There are two ways to utilize dependencies:
by way of environment / services,
and share suitable requests (codebase) pattern for various types of Reactive dependencies that
are important for dependency injection.
//Triangle Dependency is used extensively across modules that are controlled through agent manager

### Examination of Current Dependencies
Understanding these singleton anti-patterns:
```python
# Singleton pattern application in core/application.py
class AgentManager:
def get_agent():
    return AgentManager()
*
Rather than call the Singleton-patterned structure directly:
```python
#Current Singleton Usage For Agent Dependency.
from appservice import get_agent_manager
#Python standard APIास्त��

### Adding Agencies and Dependency Managemen
We can add DependencyInjection class typically across most code hierarchy.
In practical implementation application strategies:
there are seven (!*) ways to retaina class dependent on another class.

1. By assigning values as argument on function creation
2.From RequestArgument module including (FIFO queue provided)
3.SEPID module to call required Item
4.RequestParametersModule => Dependency Classification:
   - Process across module
   - model variation دراسات
4.Consult provider on services in Controller.
5.PostThread pool.



5. Background Tasks.

Based on an updated directory structure, from manual Reference, dictated, testing.
        knowledge_graph performs agent manager.
        - Complete source files  : depend on corei knowledge, slight changes.

Solutions of triply nested functions can be unrul fried.

Importing as in refactoring for comodam with imports.

## Using Dependency class:

Newly implemented version:

```python

# Dependency Injection with agent manager
from fastapi import Depend

def get_agent():  # cutting corner store
    return agent_class

#Modifications:

def finalizing dependencies:
from language_manager
