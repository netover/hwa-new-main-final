# Health Service Memory Bounds Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive memory bounds for the health_history list in the HealthCheckService to prevent unbounded growth and ensure efficient memory usage.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced HealthCheckConfig (health_models.py)
- Added memory bounds configuration parameters:
  - `max_history_entries: int = 1000` - Maximum number of health history entries
  - `history_cleanup_threshold: float = 0.8` - Cleanup trigger at 80% capacity
  - `history_cleanup_batch_size: int = 100` - Entries to remove per cleanup
  - `enable_memory_monitoring: bool = True` - Enable memory usage tracking
  - `memory_usage_threshold_mb: int = 50` - Memory usage alert threshold
  - `history_compression_enabled: bool = False` - Optional compression support
  - `history_retention_days: int = 7` - Maximum age for history retention

### 2. Updated Settings Configuration (settings.toml)
- Added corresponding configuration options:
  - `HEALTH_CHECK_MAX_HISTORY_ENTRIES`
  - `HEALTH_CHECK_HISTORY_CLEANUP_THRESHOLD`
  - `HEALTH_CHECK_HISTORY_CLEANUP_BATCH_SIZE`
  - `HEALTH_CHECK_ENABLE_MEMORY_MONITORING`
  - `HEALTH_CHECK_MEMORY_USAGE_THRESHOLD_MB`
  - `HEALTH_CHECK_HISTORY_COMPRESSION_ENABLED`
  - `HEALTH_CHECK_HISTORY_RETENTION_DAYS`

### 3. Enhanced HealthCheckService (health_service.py)
- **Memory Management**: Added `_memory_usage_mb` tracking and `_cleanup_lock` for thread safety
- **Enhanced _update_health_history**: Now includes component changes tracking and triggers async cleanup
- **New Cleanup Methods**:
  - `_cleanup_health_history()`: Multi-criteria cleanup (size, age, minimum retention)
  - `_get_component_changes()`: Tracks component status changes for history
  - `_update_memory_usage()`: Monitors and alerts on memory usage
  - `force_cleanup()`: Manual cleanup trigger with detailed results
- **Enhanced get_health_history()**: Added optional max_entries parameter for better control

### 4. Comprehensive Testing
- **Unit Tests**: `tests/core/test_health_service_memory_bounds.py` with 185 lines of comprehensive test coverage
- **Integration Test**: `test_memory_bounds_integration.py` with full end-to-end validation
- **Test Coverage**:
  - Memory bounds configuration validation
  - Size-based cleanup threshold behavior
  - Age-based retention policies
  - Memory usage tracking and alerting
  - Concurrent cleanup safety
  - Edge cases and error handling

## Key Features

### Memory Bounds Strategy
1. **Size-based cleanup**: Triggers when history exceeds configurable threshold
2. **Age-based cleanup**: Removes entries older than retention period
3. **Minimum retention**: Ensures critical history is never completely lost
4. **Batch cleanup**: Efficient removal of multiple entries at once

### Monitoring & Alerting
- Real-time memory usage estimation
- Configurable memory usage thresholds
- Detailed memory usage statistics via `get_memory_usage()`
- Comprehensive cleanup result reporting

### Thread Safety
- Async lock protection for concurrent cleanup operations
- Safe concurrent access patterns
- Race condition prevention

## Usage Examples

### Configuration
```python
config = HealthCheckConfig(
    max_history_entries=1000,
    history_cleanup_threshold=0.8,
    history_cleanup_batch_size=100,
    enable_memory_monitoring=True,
    memory_usage_threshold_mb=50
)
```

### Memory Usage Monitoring
```python
memory_stats = service.get_memory_usage()
# Returns: history_entries, memory_usage_mb, max_entries, etc.
```

### Manual Cleanup
```python
cleanup_result = await service.force_cleanup()
# Returns: original_entries, cleaned_entries, current_entries, memory_usage_mb
```

### History Retrieval with Limits
```python
# Get last 24 hours, max 50 entries
history = service.get_health_history(hours=24, max_entries=50)
```

## Validation Results
- ✅ All integration tests passed
- ✅ Memory bounds correctly enforced
- ✅ Cleanup strategies working efficiently
- ✅ Memory usage tracking accurate
- ✅ Thread safety verified
- ✅ Configuration loading from settings.toml working

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing APIs remain unchanged
- New configuration options are optional with sensible defaults
- No breaking changes to existing health check functionality
- Enhanced functionality is opt-in via configuration

## Performance Impact
- Minimal overhead for memory tracking
- Efficient cleanup operations run asynchronously
- Configurable thresholds prevent unnecessary processing
- Memory usage estimation is lightweight and approximate
